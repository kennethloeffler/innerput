# Innerput
Innerput is a library that sends keyboard input to a desired application. It was [purpose-built for a program the rbx-dom crate](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/181#issuecomment-855307470). As such, it lacks many, many features, its documentation is sparse to non-existent, and it only supports Windows.
